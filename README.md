# Control-of-mobile-robots-simulations
Simulations I produced while learning to control mobile robots

I have made these programs to practice and explore the concepts I learnt, wWhile following along the Youtube series by Professor Egerstedt of Georgia Tech on the Control of Mobile Robots  

I have used the Mobile Robotics Simulation Toolbox along with standard Matlab toolboxes.
