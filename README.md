# Control-of-mobile-robots-simulations
Simulations I produced while learning to control mobile robots

While following along the Youtube series by Professor Egerstedt on the Control of Mobile Robots I have made these to practice and explore the concepts I learnt.

The Mobile Robotics Simulation Toolbox along with standard Matlab toolboxes have been used in this.
